    Reflection on how you see this tutorial helping you approach future web projects.

The main learning objectives of this tutorial were to show how to start a website with the back end programming, and some front end. Challenges included working on the challenges at the end of the parts. Working through the deleting and updating forms were my biggest challenges. Through working through this, I have more of an understanging of web servers, and the full process of deploying a site.
